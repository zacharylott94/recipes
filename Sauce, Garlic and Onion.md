## Notes

I first made this with more garlic. After the sauce sat overnight, the garlic overpowered the other flavors. If it doesn't taste like it has enough garlic when you first mix it, I'd advise waiting a while for it to sit in the fridge before tweaking it.

This sauce *will* separate over time. Just give it a shake or mix before putting it on food.

This goes good on sandwiches, salads, chicken and rice, and wraps. Really, anywhere you need some moisture and some garlic and onion, this would go good on.
