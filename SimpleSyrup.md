# Simple Syrup
## Ingredients
1:1 ratio by weight water:sugar

## Equipment
- sauce pan
- container for syrup

## Instructions
1. Throw both ingredients in a pan and cook until all of the sugar is dissolved.

## Notes
I do my simple syrup ratio by weight so that when I measure it out, I know that whatever the weight of my syrup, half that weight is sugar.
