# Baked Custard Base

___

## Ingredients

* 200g whole milk
* 250g heavy cream
* 90g sugar
* A pinch of salt
* 1/2 tsp vanilla
* 6 egg yolks

## Equipment

* Sauce pan
* Large baking dish
* Measuring spoon (1/2 tsp)
* Whisk
* Large mixing bowl
* Rammekins

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350F.
2. Separate the yolks into a mixing bowl. You should save your whites for some other recipe.
3. Pour your milk and cream into a saucepan.
4. Heat to no higher than 180F. Remove from heat.
5. Slowly whisk the milk and cream into the bowl with the egg yolks.
6. After the milk and cream is incorporated, add the vanilla.
7. Place rammekins into the large baking dish.
8. Transfer mixture from the bowl into the rammekins.
9. Fill the large baking dish with hot water up to about halfway on the rammekins.
10. Bake in the oven for 30 - 40 minutes. Really, bake it until the custards are set. You can tell that when they aren't as liquidy when you shake them.
11. Once you take the custards out, immediately remove them from the hot water bath to stop the cooking process.
12. Let cool on the counter before covering and transfering to the fridge. Let them fully chill.

## Notes

This recipe can fill 6 standard rammekins.


This recipe is really only meant as a base custard for other flavors. I've used this recipe to make several other flavors: Chocolate, Vanilla, Coffee, Maple, Spiced. Most flavors you can just add to the base before transferring to the rammekins. The one thing to watch out for is any extra sugar your flavor might add, such as with chocolate and maple syrup. I try to reduce the sugar in the base or substitute it entirely in those cases.
