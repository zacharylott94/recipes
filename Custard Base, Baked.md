# Baked Custard Base

___

## Ingredients

* 450g half and half
* 90g sugar
* A pinch of salt
* 1/2 tsp vanilla
* 6 egg yolks

## Equipment

* Sauce pan
* Large baking dish
* Measuring spoon (1/2 tsp)
* Whisk
* Large mixing bowl
* Rammekins

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350F.
2. Separate the yolks into a mixing bowl. You should save your whites for some other recipe.
3. Pour half (225g) of the your half and half into the sauce pan along with the sugar.
4. Heat to a simmer. Remove from heat.
5. Add the rest of the half and half and the vanilla.
6. Slowly whisk the sauce pan mixture into the bowl with the egg yolks.
7. Place rammekins into the large baking dish.
8. Transfer mixture from the bowl into the rammekins.
9. Fill the large baking dish with hot water up to about halfway on the rammekins.
10. Bake in the oven for 30 - 40 minutes. Really, bake it until the custards are set. You can tell that when they aren't as liquidy when you shake them.
11. Once you take the custards out, immediately remove them from the hot water bath to stop the cooking process.
12. Let cool on the counter before covering and transfering to the fridge. Let them fully chill.

## Notes

The rammekins I use are larger. This recipe doesn't quite fill three of my rammekins, so I just evenly distribute the custard in them. This works out for me because there are three people in my household. Most people probably have the smaller, white rammekins. I would think this recipe would fill 6 of those, but I don't know for sure. If you use smaller rammekins, I'd suggest baking for a shorter time and checking the custards more often.

This recipe is really only meant as a base custard for other flavors. I've used this recipe to make several other flavors: Chocolate, Vanilla, Coffee, Maple, Spiced. Most flavors you can just add to the base. The one thing to watch out for is any extra sugar your flavor might add, such as with chocolate and maple syrup. I try to reduce the sugar in the base or substitute it entirely in those cases.
