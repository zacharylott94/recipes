# Baked Chocolate Custard

___

## Ingredients

* 200g heavy cream
* 250g whole milk
* 140g semi-sweet chocolate chips
* 6 egg yolks

## Equipment

* Sauce pan
* Large baking dish
* Whisk
* Large mixing bowl
* 6 Rammekins

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350F.
2. Separate the yolks into a mixing bowl. You should save your whites for some other recipe.
3. Pour heavy cream into the sauce pan along with the chocolate.
4. Heat to a simmer. Remove from heat.
5. Add the milk to the sauce pan and whisk.
6. Slowly whisk the sauce pan mixture into the bowl with the egg yolks.
7. Place rammekins into the large baking dish.
8. Transfer mixture from the bowl into the rammekins.
9. Fill the large baking dish with hot water up to about halfway on the rammekins.
10. Bake in the oven for 30 - 40 minutes. Really, bake it until the custards are set. You can tell that when they aren't as liquidy when you shake them.
11. Once you take the custards out, immediately remove them from the hot water bath to stop the cooking process.
12. Let cool on the counter before covering and transfering to the fridge. Let them fully chill.

## Notes

This recipe I made with 6 regular sized rammekins (if there *is* a regular size). This recipe fills those 6 rammekins very nicely. With the smaller rammekins, this recipe only took 30 minutes to bake.

Some things I would change are:

* Use less chocolate: It's very strong. So strong, it would drown out any other flavors you may want to add.
* Use vanilla and salt: I totally forgot these when I made it. I will definitely add some next time.
* Use a dark chocolate
