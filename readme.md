# Zach's Kitchen Hacking
Greetings! This is where I keep all of my kitchen recipes (and all of my iterations). Feel free to try these yourself, and, if you want, you can give me feedback in github's issues tab.

**Please note that I heavily prefer using weight measurements over volumetric measurements.** I apologize to any cooks who are used to volumetric measurements, and I do not plan on listing volumetric measurements beside the weight measurements.

I use [Obsidian Notes](https://obsidian.md) to maintain these recipes in a folder in an Obsidian vault. Rather than pay money for Obsidian Publish, I just `git push` lol.
