# Brown Sugar Custard

___

## Ingredients

* 200g cream
* 250g milk
* 90g light brown sugar
* A pinch of salt
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 6 egg yolks

## Equipment

* Sauce pan
* Large baking dish
* Measuring spoon (1/2 tsp)
* Whisk
* Large mixing bowl
* Rammekins

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350F.
2. Separate the yolks into a mixing bowl. Save the whites for some other recipe.
3. Whisk together the yolks and the sugar.
4. Pour the milk into the sauce pan.
5. Heat to a simmer. Remove from heat.
6. Add the cream and vanilla to the pan.
7. Slowly whisk the sauce pan mixture into the bowl with the egg yolks and sugar.
8. Place rammekins into the large baking dish.
9. Transfer mixture from the bowl into the rammekins.
10. Fill the large baking dish with hot water up to about halfway on the rammekins.
11. Bake in the oven for 30 - 40 minutes. Really, bake it until the custards are set. They are ready when they aren't liquidy when shaken.
12. Take the custards out of the oven, immediately remove them from the hot water bath to stop the cooking process.
13. Let cool on the counter before covering and transfering to the fridge. Let them fully chill.

## Notes

I used more of a standard sized rammekin for this recipe. It doesn't quite fill 6. I'm not sure if all of the custard base will fit in just 5, so you may have to pour all of them slightly under like I did for 6.
